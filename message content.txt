========================================
Hey,
I hope you are well.

The students are stating urgencies to visit their hostel rooms over the
emails. If you, irrespective of the year, also have necessities to visit
your room and have travelling permission from the responsible government
officials, then please visit the following portal to block a slot:
https://gymkhana.iitb.ac.in/BaggageCollection/.

Please check all the travelling norms issued by the government before
intending to travel and strictly obey them. Please keep your safety at
the utmost priority, avoid unnecessary travelling. At present, there is
no last date for this, use it as and when required. Institute will take
proper care of your belongings, and appropriate arrangements will be
made for those who can not travel due to the restrictions.

Following are some guidelines to be observed inside the campus:
1. The students can come themselves or authorise someone on their behalf
to visit the campus. We will mention the students and authorised persons
as visitors from here on in this email.
2. There are two slots in a day from 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM and 2:00 PM to
5:30 PM. The visitors can visit only once in a slot for the entire
window. Please avoid visiting on Sundays.
3. Only 50 visitors(this number doesn't include the accompanying
persons) are allowed in a slot. The 51st person cannot choose that slot.
4. Two people can accompany the student or the authorised person. But
out of three, at least one person should be female in case visiting the
female hostel, and male in case visiting the male hostel.
5. Please report to the hall manager office before proceeding towards
the room. You can find the contact number of your respective hall
manager on the portal.

Note: The blocked slot = confirmed slot, you will not receive any email
stating it explicitly.

For any queries, please contact your respective Hostel General
Secretary.

Regards,
Hostel General Secretaries' Committee
